# Spot

This project tends to investigate the Spotify API as well as the lightweight Alpine.js framework. Featured in this project is the Laravel-Spotify package, a Spotify Web API wrapper for Laravel which provides straight forward methods for each endpoint and a fluent interface for optional parameters. Song previews are also available for select tracks which are available upon search.
